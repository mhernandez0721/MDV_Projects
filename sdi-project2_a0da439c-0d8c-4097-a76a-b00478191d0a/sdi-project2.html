    <h1>SDI 1405: Michelle Hernandez</h1>
    <h2>Project 2</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>The theme for this week project is "How to make a crochet beanie. 
I chose that theme because it is what I like to do on my spare time. 
I learn to crochet from my mother and from books that I have taken out of the library."</p>
<p>You may also use this space to explain any elements of your code story that may not be entirely clear.  For example, if your theme is thirteenth century Italian poetry, not everyone may be familiar with that.</p>
<p>Don't forget to replace all of the capitalized elements in this template with your information.  Your term number should be in a <em>yymm</em> format, including the year and the month.</p>
