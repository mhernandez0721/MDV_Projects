<p>The theme for this week project is "How to make a crochet beanie. 
I chose that theme because it is what I like to do on my spare time. 
I learn to crochet from my mother and from books that I have taken out of the library."</p>
<p> In my code I chose the two stitches that I use often and I showed the process round for round as best as I could. 
I had a very hard time trying to put this code together but I think I managed to do it ok compared to my last project.
